        Hello! My name is Beatriz, and I'm a recent graduate from the Escola
        Superior de Media Artes e Design, where I earned a degree in Tecnologias
        e Sistemas de Informação para a Web. At 20 years old, I’m passionate
        about technology, web development, and UI design. My academic journey
        has equipped me with the skills to build creative, efficient, and
        user-friendly web solutions.<br /><br />
        When I'm not working, I love playing guitar and relaxing with a good TV
        show. I’m always eager to learn and excited for the opportunities ahead!

        During my course, I had the opportunity to intern at Kendir Studios,
        where I was responsible for the UI design of two projects. This hands-on
        experience allowed me to apply my knowledge in a real-world setting
        while collaborating with a talented team. It was a valuable opportunity
        to not only refine my existing design skills but also to learn new
        techniques and approaches that have broadened my expertise.
